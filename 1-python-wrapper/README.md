# 1 - Python wrapper

We take the iris data set and train a simple classification model for it.

* Training code should go in `training`
* A module with a `predict` function should be put into `model`
* A flask interface and main app should be put in `wrapper`

## Expected format

predict: { "f1": 0, "f2" :1, "f3": 2 } => { "class": "predicted_class" }

## How to start

* Document how to start the flask api here
